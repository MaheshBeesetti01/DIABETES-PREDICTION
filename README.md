üìà Empowering Early Diabetes Detection with Machine Learning and Flask
Diabetes, a global health challenge affecting millions, requires early detection for effective intervention. To address this, I developed a diabetes risk prediction system using machine learning and deployed it as an intuitive Flask web application to provide accessible, user-friendly health insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components of the Project:
Data Preparation: Laying a Strong Foundation
Utilized the diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv dataset.
Ensured data quality through meticulous preprocessing:
Handled missing values and resolved inconsistencies.
Detected and addressed outliers for accurate modeling.
Transformed categorical variables and normalized numerical features for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiling Insights
Conducted detailed EDA to understand feature relationships and patterns, providing actionable insights for the model development process.

Model Development: Predicting Diabetes Risk
Evaluated various ML algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Random Forests
The Random Forest algorithm emerged as the most accurate and reliable model for diabetes prediction.

Flask Web Application: Bridging Technology and Usability
Designed a Flask-based web application to make diabetes risk assessment accessible:
Homepage: Users can input essential health indicators through an intuitive interface.
Result Page: Displays personalized diabetes risk predictions in a clear and comprehensible format.

üöÄ Future Enhancements:
Adding explainability features like SHAP or LIME to enhance user trust in predictions.
Expanding functionality to include multi-disease prediction models.
Enhancing the user interface with modern frameworks like React for a richer user experience.
